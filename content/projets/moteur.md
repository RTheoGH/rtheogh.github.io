summary: "Game Engine - C++/OpenGL"
---

**Pawformer** is a 3D **platformer game** prototype developed from scratch.
The goal of the project was to design a small but functional game engine capable of handling **physics**, **collisions**, **rendering**, and **camera control** — all applied to an interactive game scenario.

In Pawformer, you control a **cat** navigating through a series of platforms, using **jump mechanics**, **momentum**, and precise **collision detection** to progress through the environment.
The game can be played from **third-person** or **first-person** perspectives, and even includes a **free camera mode** used for debugging and scene exploration.

The engine supports:

- **Scene graph management** for hierarchical transformations.
- **Basic physics and collision system**, handling simple and transformed meshes.
- **Object interactions**, including “grabbable” items.
- **Lighting models**, with both **Phong** and **PBR** rendering options.
- Custom user **interface** using **ImGui**.

Developed entirely in **C++**, Pawformer demonstrates a deep understanding of the principles behind 3D engines, from rendering pipelines to physics simulation.
